# General Info
* This software is very old and is not created well at all, very slow, very incorrect, very bad algorithms, you name it
* This software hasnt been updated for almost a year now and I could care less about trying to, the source code is practically impossible to work with and the game this was created for is a dead game now
* This software was originally created to help me find broken rebirth in a game called "[Muscle Legends](https://www.roblox.com/games/3623096087/Muscle-Legends)" that would allow you to punch a rock for 3 days straight and level your pet up to an insane amount (dumb as fuck am I right lol)
* Pretty dumb crappy software but useful for people who like to rebirth on that game thats now a pile of degenerates
